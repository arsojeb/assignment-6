1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?

    Ans: Difference between var, let, and const:
            i.   var – Old way to declare variables. It can be re-declared and updated. 
                 It has function scope, which sometimes causes problems.
            ii.  let – Newer way to declare variables. Can be updated but cannot be re-declared in the same scope.
