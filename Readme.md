1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?

    Ans: Difference between var, let, and const:
            i.   var – Old way to declare variables. It can be re-declared and updated. 
                 It has function scope, which sometimes causes problems.
            ii.  let – Newer way to declare variables. Can be updated but cannot be re-declared in the same scope.

            iii. const – Used for variables that cannot be updated or re-declared. Also block scoped.

2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()? 

    Ans: Difference between map(), forEach(), and filter():
            i.   forEach() – Loops through an array and does something with each item. It does not return a new array.
            
            ii.  map() – Loops through an array and returns a new array after changing each item.
            
            iii  filter() – Loops through an array and returns a new array with only items that match a condition.

3) What are arrow functions in ES6?

    Ans: Arrow functions in ES6 are :
            i. Shorter way to write functions. Uses => instead of function.

            ii. Shortcut: If only one parameter, you can skip parentheses.

4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?

    Ans: Destructuring assignment is a way to extract values from arrays or objects and store them in variables easily.
         It helps to write cleaner and shorter code instead of accessing each value individually.

5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?

    Ans: Template literals are a way to create strings using backticks `. 
         They allow you to insert variables or expressions directly into the string and also support multi-line strings. 
         They are cleaner and easier to use than the old way of joining strings with +.
